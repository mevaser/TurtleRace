# Day 19: 100 Days of Python

This project is a fun and interactive **Turtle Race Game** created as part of Day 19 in the "100 Days of Python" course. The game demonstrates the use of the `turtle` module for graphics and user interaction.

## Features
- **Bet on a Turtle:** The user is prompted to place a bet on the color of the turtle they think will win.
- **Random Movement:** Each turtle moves forward by a random distance in each iteration, simulating a race.
- **Colorful Graphics:** Six turtles in different colors (`red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`) compete in the race.
- **Outcome Display:** The program announces whether the user's bet was correct and displays the winning turtle's color.

## Key Python Concepts Demonstrated
- **Modules:** Utilizes `turtle` for graphics and `random` for unpredictability in movement.
- **Loops and Lists:** Creates and manages multiple turtles using loops and list data structures.
- **User Interaction:** Captures input via `turtle.textinput` to make the game interactive.
- **Conditional Logic:** Determines the race winner and checks the user's bet.

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your bet for the winning turtle's color when prompted.
3. Watch the race and see if your chosen turtle wins!

This project combines Python programming with fun visuals and randomness to create an engaging mini-game. Perfect for beginners looking to enhance their skills in Python while having fun! üê¢üé®
